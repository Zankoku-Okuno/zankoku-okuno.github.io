Goodbyte, and Good Luck

[Here's my internet presence](http://zankoku-okuno.github.com)

To build this site, you will need Hakyll, which is the Haskell port of Jekyll.

Since the site is static, there's no place to add comments directly. If you're inclined to berate, erm, chat with me, you can open an issue on [the github](https://github.com/Zankoku-Okuno/zankoku-okuno.github.io/issues).
