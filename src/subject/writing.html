<p>I don’t always write, and I’m not even sure I’m even decent: I certainly haven’t had any training. Even so, writing is still fun. From time-to-time, I’ll have inspiration for a haiku<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, or a very short story, and eventually I might even think it’s gotten good enough to share.</p>

    <li id="fn1"><p>I write <em>real</em> haiku, as in 俳句, not English-language haiku, which is totally different. Compared to Japanese haiku, English haiku are 2-3 times more massive.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
  </ol>
