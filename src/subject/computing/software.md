======

* Neptune -- the world's most RESTful web server framework
* Unicoder -- a command-line tool for writing unicode documents
* unknown name -- a suite of online tools for building and sharing conlangs


Languages
---------

I'm developing a suite of programming languages. No single programming language can handle all tasks. Each language brings modern principles of abstraction to a different field: scripting, application programming, system programming.

* Octopus -- the full-metal abstraction programming language
* Murex -- the friendly language that takes programming in the large seriously
* Nautilus -- the no-nonsense, high-level systems programming language

To do this, I need a specific set of tools to build my compilers and interpreters:

* Luthor -- a suite of parsing and lexing utilities for building complex grammars
* Distfix -- desugar distributed affixes
* L3 -- cross-platform assembly

Wishlist
========

* Hajj -- a generic structured data model
* port OpenGL tutorials to Haskell

Longshots
=========
* unknown name -- a markdown engine written and configured in Haskell
* Templar -- a templating engine
* unknown name -- massive-scale turn-based strategy game
* a series of alife simulations
