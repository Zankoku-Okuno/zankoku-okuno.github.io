My email is `zankoku <dot> okuno <at> gmail <dot> com`, but be aware that I may or may not remember to check it.

A faster way to contact me is by opening an issue on a relevant one of my github projects. I at least am on the site more regularly. Of course, anything you post there will be public.

Since this site is hosted statically, there's no comment system. If you would like to comment on an article, you can open an issue on the site's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Zankoku-Okuno/zankoku-okuno.github.io/issues).
